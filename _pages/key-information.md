## Storage Options for the PSP
The PSP uses Sony's proprietary memory format called Memory Stick Duo, Memory Stick PRO Duo, and Memory Stick Micro (M2). These removable flash media formats are no longer being produced.
If you want to upgrade your storage, we recommend using a microSD to Memory Stick PRO Duo Adapter in conjunction with a microSD instead of buying an old, used Memory Stick.
You can buy a new microSD in conjunction with a microSD to Memory Stick PRO Duo Adapter cheaply, and they provide much more storage than a regular Memory Stick.

| PSP Model | Memory Stick (PRO) Duo | Memory Stick Micro | microSD to Memory Stick Adapter |
|:---------|:----------------------:|:------------------:|:-------------------------------:|
| 10XX  |   ✔  | ❌ | ✔       |
| 20XX  |   ✔  | ❌ | ✔       |
| 30XX  |   ✔  | ❌ | ✔       |
| N10XX |   ❌ | ✔  | ( ✔ ) [^2]  |
| E1004 |   ✔  | ❌ | ✔       |

[^2]: While microSD to Memory Stick PRO Duo Adapters exist for the PSP go, they are not widely available and require the disassembly of the device in order to install it inside housing of the console.
