# PSP-Guide
A step-by-step guide on how to install custom firmware on any retail PSP model, regardless of the firmware version.


## What is custom Firmware?
Custom Firmware (CFW) is a software modification for the official firmware on your PSP, allowing for full access to your PSP's hardware, without being limited by the features that the original firmware by Sony provides.


**Popular uses for custom firmware on the PSP include**:
- Running unsigned homebrew software like games
- Bypassing UMD Movies region lock
- Customization of the appearance of the XMB through CXMB themes
- Customization of the system through the installation of plugins
- Backing up your physical games and run them directly from a Memory Stick
- Playing modified games (Mods/Fan translations)
- Playing older retro games through emulators


**What does the guide install?**

This guide will install the following onto your PSP console:
- Install the ARK-4 custom firmware on an unmodified retail PSP console
- Install either cIPL or Infinity 2 to make the CFW persistent between shutdowns (optional)
