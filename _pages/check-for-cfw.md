## Checking for already installed CFW

1. Power on your console
2. Go to System Settings -> System Information
3. The installed System Software will be displayed (e.g., 6.61, 6.60, 5.00, etc.)
4. If the displayed System Version contains additional symbols or words e.g., "Pro-C", "LME", &infin, "cIPL;
there is a custom firmware or CFW autoboot solution installed.
5. We recommend to follow the [uninstalling old CFW guide](/uninstall/)
