## Installing ARK-4

### Requirements:
- [ARK-4](https://github.com/PSP-Archive/ARK-4/releases/latest)

## Section I - Preparing for installation
1. Download the latest release of [ARK-4](https://github.com/PSP-Archive/ARK-4/releases/latest).
2. Open or extract the **ARK4.zip** ZIP-Archive.
3. Connect your PSP or storage media to your PC.
4. Copy the **ARK_01234 folder** from the ARK4.zip to */PSP/SAVEDATA/*.
5. Copy the **ARK_Loader** folder from the ARK4.zip to */PSP/GAME/*.
6. Disconnect your PSP or storage media from your PC.


## Section II - Installing ARK-4
1. On your PSP go to Game -> Memory Stick / Internal Storage and start **ARK Loader**.
2. Your PSP PSP will restart and boot into ARK-4.

## Section III - Check Installation
1. While in the PSP's XMB, press **SELECT** in order to bring up the VSH menu.
2. Press **SELECT** again in order to close VSH menu.

If you're unable to bring up the VSH menu, you probably forgot to copy the ARK_1234 folder to /PSP/SAVEDATA/. Repeat the steps in Section I and retry the installation.

3. Go to System Settings -> System Information.
4. Your System Software should display ARK-4.20.XX Live

## Section IV - Optional Steps
At this point, the Live[^1] version of ARK-4 is installed on your PSP. This means that it is required to start **ARK Loader** every time you power on the console. In order to make the ARK-4 persisent between shutdowns, you can either install **Infinity 2** or **cIPL**, depending on the model of your console.

[^1]: The Live version requires you to start ARK Loader every time you power on the console in order to boot into ARK-4.

## Section IV - Making the Install Persistent (Optional)

In this section of the guide we are going to install either Infinity 2 or cIPL onto your console in order to make the install of ARK-4 persistent between shutdowns.

## Choosing Between Infinity 2 and cIPL
cIPL is known to be slightly faster than Infinity 2, but it is not compatible with every model of the PSP.
We recommand to install cIPL if your console is supported, otherwise just install Infinity 2, which is compatible with every model.

| Model | cIPL | Infinity 2 |
|:------|:----:|:----------:|
| 10XX | ✔ | ✔ |
| 20XX | ✔ | ✔ |
| 30XX | (✔)[^2] | ✔ |
| N10XX | ❌ | ✔ |
| E1004 | ❌ | ✔ |


[^2]: Only early 30XX models are supported (3g). If you're unsure about the compatability on your PSP 30XX console, you can simply follow the cIPL installation. The cIPL installer will notify you in case that your model isn't compatible and stop the installation. From that point, you can simply switch to the instructions on installing Infinity 2 instead.

## Installing cIPL
1. Connect your PSP or storage media to your PC.
2. Copy the **ARK_cIPL** folder that is found in the **PSP** folder from the ARK4.zip to /PSP/GAME/.
3. Disconnect your PSP or storage media from your PC.
4. On your PSP go to Game.
5. Select Memory Stick / Internal Storage
